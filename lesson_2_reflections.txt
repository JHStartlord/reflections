What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
With git an empty repository is created. Now it is possible to add files to the
repository and check them in. A repository is needed, so git knows that this is
a directory which it should work on.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?
With the staging area, I can add files selectivly, only the ones I like.
I could leave out unwanted files, like debug information, or autogerernated 
files, which would only eat up space in the repository.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical
change?

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history
organized? How would branches help?

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?

What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it in
the diagram the way we do?

What are the pros and cons of Git’s automatic merging vs. always doing merges
manually?
