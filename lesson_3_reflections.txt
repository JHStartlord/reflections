When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    To work with different people, to work alone on one project on diffent sites,
    to backup my local repository in the cloud.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    If I work on same branch then someone else, I would have to merge every
	time a push was done by someone else. On the other hand, if I am a user
	of the content of the branch and not contirbuting, I would like to have
	the newest version always ready. Sometimes I rely as a user on the 
	current version and don't want any automatic changes, then I would
	prefer manual pulls.
